We approached them by bidding for a fixed scope short term project, that resulted in us being hired for a two year engagement across their product suite.
      
      
We picked up the pieces of an unlaunched prototype when we joined which we launched, supported and helped them grow. 


We then embarked on a larger pivot, to include a better user experience on [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) stack with more automation. We did analysis on and integrated [Open Banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_banking). 


While partnering with them we consolidated their infrastructure to be [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) defined, and containerized all their [golang](https://golang.org/), java and python services on [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/).
