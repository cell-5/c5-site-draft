            Blending the right delivery team is the most important ingredient for success. 
            

            We build a team with the right skills with your help.
        - heading: 3. Product Roadmap
          text: >
            We work with you to agree on our first milestones. We are looking for 4-12 weeks of work to be sketched out making up an MVP or major release feature-set. 


            It wonâ€™t take us that long to deliver value. We will aim to have a live working product in the first two weeks. 


            But before we can take ove the world we need a plan.

        - heading: 3. Weekly Product Steering
          text: >
            We meet every week to check our progress against plan. We reset priorities for the coming week based on new product, customer and business data. 
        - heading: 2. Daily Team Checkpoint
          text: >
            In remote teams like ours communication is key. We have a single Slack channel, and a single daily meeting to help the team to check-in with each other and help each other out. 
        - heading: 1. Continuous Delivery
          text: >
            We use practises from DevOps, CI/CD and XP to encourage and enable regular commits and production releases. Live demos are the norm.
